# Nextflix 
A simple Netflix Clone made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ⚡

Currently, I have implemented the basic UI with media details fetch functionality.


Deployed it using vercel [here](https://nextflix-azure.vercel.app/).

Please leave a ⭐ as motivation if you liked the implementation 😄
